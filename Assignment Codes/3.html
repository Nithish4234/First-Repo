       <h1>Responsive website layout</h1>
       <p>HTML Responsive Web Design is a dynamic approach to web design that ensures web pages look good on all devices. It involves the automatic adjustment of HTML elements such as resizing, hiding, showing, shrinking, and expanding, depending on the device and screen size used. This means the web pages will automatically adapt to the screen size of the device in use, providing an optimal viewing experience.</p>
       <p>We will demonstrate different examples of how we can create an HTML responsive web design so that it will adjust according to the screen size of the device used.</p>
