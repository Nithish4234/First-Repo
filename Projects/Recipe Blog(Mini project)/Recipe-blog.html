                    <h2>Dal</h2>
                    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
                    <p> 1 cup masoor dal <br>
                        3 and 1/2 cups water <br>
                        1/2 tsp turmeric <br>
                        1 cup onions finely diced <br>
                        3 tbsp neutral oil <br>
                        1 large tomato <br>
                        1 tsp salt</p>
                    <h4>Cooking Process:</h4>
                    <p> Combine the lentils, water, whole garlic cloves and turmeric.
                        Bring to a simmer, reduce heat and cover. Bringing the pot to a boil when covered gets incredibly messy.
                        Cook until the lentils have disintegrated. Stir them along the way to prevent them from sticking. If you can see a whole lentil you need to cook them some more. This should take about 45 minutes.
                        Remove from heat and set aside.
                        Make the final flavour burst
                        Do this while your lentils cook if you're pressed for time.
                        Heat a not too big skillet over medium low heat. Add the oil. When the oil starts to shimmer add the onions. Sweat the onions, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent. This takes around 5 minutes or so.
                        Toss in the diced jalapeño and cook for another minute.
                        You want the oil to form little bubbles around the seeds. See them all move just a little. Like a whole spice rave in the pan. Let the spices party for about 30 seconds.
                        Toss in the tomato and the cilantro and continue cooking until the tomato is just warmed through.
                        Fold the mixture into the dal. Add the salt. Taste.</p>

                    <h2>Palak Paneer</h2>
                    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
                    <p> 1 tsp kashmiri chili powder <br>
                        1 tsp kasoor methi <br>
                        1/2 tsp salt <br>
                        palak paneer <br>
                        3 tbsp vegetable oil <br>
                        2 tbsp onion finely diced<br>
                        2 tbsp green chili finely diced<br>
                        4 oz frozen spinach – the finely diced stuff<br>
                        1 tbsp garlic ginger paste <br>
                        1/2 tbsp tomato paste <br>
                        1/6 lemon juiced<br>
                        10 oz paneer cut into bite size pieces</p>
                    <h4>Cooking Process:</h4>
                    <p>Have your curry base simmering on the stove. Make your spice mix. Chop all the ingredients and have them at the ready. This is going to go very fast. You don't have time to mess around.
                        Thaw the spinach. Drain it well.
                        Heat a skillet over medium heat.
                        Add the oil. When it shimmers add the onion and green chilies. Cook, stirring constantly, until the onions just start to brown on the edges. This takes 2-3 minutes.
                        Add the garlic ginger paste and cook until it stops sputtering, about 1 minute.
                        Lower the heat to medium low. Add the spice mix. Cook, stirring constantly, for about 30-45 seconds. You want to bloom the spices in the oil. You don't want to burn it. If you burn the spices, start again. There is no fixing it.
                        Add the diluted tomato paste and cilantro. Stir to combine and cook for about a minute.
                        Turn the heat up to medium high. Add 3 oz of the curry base. Stir to combine and cook until it it starts to crater. Little holes will appear. See the guide to Indian curries to understand what this means if you aren't sure.
                        Add another 6 oz of curry base. Stir to combine and cook until it craters.
                        Now add the remaining curry base. Cook until it craters and reduce the heat to low. Add the spinach and stir to mix. Simmer for about 5 minutes. Add the paneer and warm through. If the curry seems dry add a bit more curry base.
                        Add the fresh lemon juice. Stir to combine. Serve. Enjoy!</p>

                    <h2>Spinach and Potato Curry</h2>
                    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
                    <p> 3 Tbsp vegetable oil<br>
                        1 onion minced<br>
                        1 red chili seeded and chopped<br> 
                        1 tsp whole mustard seed<br>
                        1 tsp whole cumin seed<br>
                        1 Tbsp garlic ginger paste<br>
                        1/2 tsp turmeric<br>
                        1/2 tsp salt<br>
                        1 lb small new potatoes<br>
                        1/2 lb baby spinach coarsely chopped</p>
                    <h4>Cooking Process:</h4>
                    <p>Pre-cook the potatoes in boiling salted water. Set aside.
                        Coarsely chop the spinach.
                        Heat a saucepan large enough to hold all the ingredients over medium low heat.
                        Add the oil. When it starts to shimmer, add the cumin and mustard seed and cook until they start to barely crackle.
                        Add the oil and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft.
                        Mix in the garlic ginger paste and cook another minute or so.
                        Stir in the red chili, indian restaurant spice mix (or curry powder), turmeric and salt. Cook, stirring constantly, for about 30 to 45 seconds. Be careful not to burn the spices.
                        Add the water or curry base and cook about 30 seconds. Mix in the chopped spinach and potatoes and cover. Cook until the the spinach is wilted and potatoes are hot.</p>

                    <h2>Chicken Dum Biryani</h2>
                    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
                    <p> 1 1/2 cups basmati rice<br>
                        1 1/4 cups water<br>
                        1 cup chicken stock <br>
                        5 cloves<br>
                        2 inch cinnamon bark<br>
                        1 tsp salt<br>
                        Biryani spice mix<br>
                        1 tsp garam masala<br>
                        1/2 tsp turmeric<br>
                        2 tsp cumin powder<br>
                        1 tsp coriander powder<br>
                        1/2 tsp kasoor methi<br>
                        1 tsp kasmiri chili powder</p>
                    <h4>Cooking Process:</h4>
                    <p>If you do have a rice cooker use it. Just combine the rice ingredients and proceed as you normally do. While the rice is cooking cook the chicken.
                        If you don't have a rice cooker this is an easy way to make basmati. You can pre-soak, rinse or whatever you want but this works pretty well as written. Blasphemy. I know. But it works. I did this for years until I got a decent rice cooker.
                        Pick a saucepan with a fairly tight fitting lid that's not way too big. Combine the water, chicken stock, green cardamom, cloves, cinnamon stick, salt and the rice in your chosen saucepan.
                        Bring to a simmer over medium heat uncovered. Reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer for 20 minutes. Set a timer. Seriously. While this is going on make the chicken (see below).
                        When the timer goes off after 20 minutes, turn off the heat and let stand an additional 5 minutes. Uncover. Remove the whole spices. They should be just sitting on top. Fluff gently and replace the cover to keep the rice warm.
                        Make the chicken
                        Make the biryani spice mix. Just combine all the ingredients in a small bowl. Dilute the tomato paste. Slice your shallots. Have everything at hand.
                        Heat the oil in a saute pan over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook until they start to brown. They will brown some more in the next couple steps.
                        Add the cumin seed. Cook for about 30 seconds.
                        Add the garlic ginger paste. Stir it into the oil and cook until it stops sputtering. Watch it. Don't let it burn.
                        Turn the heat to medium low. Add the spice mix. Stir to thoroughly combine the oil in the pan with the spices. Cook for about 30 seconds. Really watch it. There should be enough oil in the pan. If the spices start to stick turn down the heat and add a bit more oil.
                        Add the diluted tomato paste, stir and turn the heat up to medium. Cook about a minute.
                        Add the chicken and cook, stirring regularly until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 150F. You want it mostly cooked. It will finish cooking in the assembled biryani.
                        Assemble the chicken biryani
                        Use a pot that's about 9-10 inches in diameter. Make sure it has a pretty tight fitting lid.
                        Put a little more than half the rice in the pot and spread it out in an even layer. Top with the chicken mixture. Add the rest of the rice. Top with the fried shallots/onions (see note if you are making them yourself). Drizzle the saffron water mixture overtop.
                        Cover the pot with tinfoil and then the lid. The tinfoil adds a little extra seal. It's not quite as good as the dough seal in a traditional biryani but it will work well enough.
                        Transfer the chicken biryani to the oven and bake for 15 minutes.
                        After the biryani has baked for 15 minutes remove it from the oven and place it on the stove. Let stand for 10 minutes.
                        To serve transfer the contents to a platter. It will get a bit messy. That's OK. The mix will look good, especially once you garnish it. It should look just like the pictures because that's exactly what I did.
                        Garnish with more fried shallots and a bit of cilantro. Dig in and enjoy.</p>

                    <img src="Images/Mutton.jpg" alt="Recipe 2">
                    <h2>Mutton Curry</h2>
                    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
                    <p> 15 kashmiri chilies the dried ones<br>
                        8 cloves garlic<br>
                        2-3 tsp kashmiri chili powder<br>
                        1 tsp turmeric<br>
                        2 tsp salt<br>
                        2 tbsp neutral oil<br>
                        enough water to form a paste<br>
                        2/3 cup plain yoghurt<br>
                        2 tsp garam masala<br>
                        3 lbs mutton cut into 1 inch chunks<br>
                        4 cups onions finely chopped<br>
                        6 tbsp neutral oil <br>
                        2 tbsp tomato paste<br>
                        1 cup water</p>
                    <h4>Cooking Process:</h4>
                    <p>Seed and stem the dried kashmiri chilies. Just break them in half and give them a shake. A few seeds won't kill you.
                        Place the chilies in hot tap water and soak until rehydrated. This takes about 30 minutes.
                        Combine the rehydrated chilies along with the rest of the paste ingredients in a blender or food processor. Add a bit of water. Puree. Keep adding water until a paste forms. Really have at it. The skins from the chilies are pretty hard to break down.
                        Marinate the lamb
                        Combine the lamb, garam masala, yoghurt and salt. Mix. Cover and refrigerate for one hour.
                        Make the laal maas
                        Pre-heat your oven to 325F.
                        Pre-heat a dutch oven large enough to hold all the ingredients over medium heat. Add 4 tbsp of oil. 
                        Add the black and green cardamom and cook for 20-30 seconds. 
                        Add the onions and cook until they are well browned. Regulate the heat to prevent burning. Stir them often.
                        Push the onions to the side around the edges of the pot. Add the remaining two tbsp oil to the middle of the pot. Pour in the laal maas curry paste and fry until it darkens. This takes a couple minutes. Stir constantly and regulate the heat to avoid the paste burning. Watch your onions.
                        Once the curry paste has darkened slightly mix it in with the onions. Add the tomato paste. Cook the onion/paste mixture over medium low heat for 4-5 minutes.
                        Add the lamb and marinade. Stir to mix everything together. Cook about 5 minutes over medium low heat. Don't forget to give it stir every minute or so.
                        Add one cup of water. Stir to combine. 
                        Cover and place the dutch oven in the 325F oven. Cook until the lamb is tender. This takes somewhere around 90 minutes to 2 hours. It depends on the size of the chunks. It's ready when it's ready.
                        Remove the pot from the oven. If the curry is a little thin simmer uncovered until you get the consistency you want. Spoon off the excess oil. But remember, there is flavour in that oil so leaving a bit behind is not the worst thing you can do...
                        Taste and adjust salt.</p>

                    <h2>Prawns Curry</h2>
                    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
                    <p> 1/2 lb prawns<br>
                        1/2 tsp turmeric<br>
                        1/2 tsp chili powder<br>
                        sprinkle of salt<br>
                        enough oil <br>
                        1 tsp garlic ginger paste<br>
                        The spice mix<br>
                        1/4 tsp black pepper<br>
                        1/2 tsp salt<br>
                        3 Tbsp oil <br>
                        2 inch cinnamon stick<br>
                        12-15 fresh curry leaves<br> 
                        1 Tbsp garlic/ginger paste<br>
                        1 Tbsp tomato paste <br>
                        1/2 cup coconut milk <br>
                        2 tbsp tomato diced<br>
                        1 green chili diced</p>
                    <h4>Cooking Process:</h4>
                    <p>Gently toss the prawns with 1/2 tsp turmeric and 1/2 tsp kashmiri chili powder. Sprinkle with salt.
                        Pick a pan that is just big enough to comfortably hold the prawns in one layer.
                        Add the oil and heat over medium low. You want enough to come up the sides of the prawns about 1/4 of the way up. That's why you want the smallest pan that fits. It will take less oil.
                        Add the garlic ginger paste and fry until it stops sizzling.
                        Cook the prawns until the bottom turns pink and they just start to go opaque on the sides. This takes somewhere between 30-45 seconds depending on how hot your pan is. Note that the times are for 16-20 prawns. You will need to adjust up or down based on the size of shrimp you use.
                        Flip the prawns and cook another 30-45 seconds or so. You don't want them fully cooked as they will cook a little more as they cool and then in the final curry. As soon as the slit in the back turns opaque you are done.
                        South Indian prawn curry
                        Make the spice mix.
                        Dilute the tomato paste with enough water to get to the consistency of passata.
                        Heat your frying pan (don't use non-stick) briefly over medium heat. Add the oil (you can use some of the oil from frying the shrimp). Use all the oil specified. It's important. You need that oil to bloom the spices. You don't want them to stick and potentially burn because you skimped on a bit of oil.
                        When the oil starts to shimmer add the cardamom and cinnamon stick. You should see little bubbles form around them. Let that go for around 20 seconds.
                        Now add the mustard and cumin seed along with the curry leaves. Stir and cook until the seeds start to crackle. This takes another 20 seconds or so.
                        Add the garlic ginger paste and large pieces of the two green chilies to the pan and cook, stirring constantly, until the paste stops sputtering.
                        Turn down the heat and add the spice mix. This is the moment of truth in any curry. Stir it constantly for 30 seconds. If it starts to darken lift the pan off the heat. You want the spice mix to cook in the oil but not burn. If it burns you are starting over. No way around it.
                        Turn the heat up to medium high. Add the diluted tomato paste immediately and stir until bubbles form (the oil will likely separate). This takes around 30 seconds to one minute depending on the heat.
                        Add 3 oz of curry base. Stir until you see small craters forming, around 30-45 seconds. If it takes much longer that's a sign that you can turn the meat up a bit more. Watch the edges of the pan. The curry can stick here. That's not a problem. Just scrape it back into the pan.
                        Now add 6 oz of curry base and stir briefly. Let it cook until the craters form again. This takes 1-2 minutes.
                        Add the rest of the curry base and let cook until the craters form. Turn the heat down to low. Add the coconut milk and stir.
                        Mix in the remaining diced green chili. Simmer for about 3-4 minutes.
                        Add the diced tomatoes. Stir to combine. Add the prawns and cook until they are just warmed through.
                        Serve with rice and/or parathas or chapatis.</p>
